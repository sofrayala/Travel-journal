## üìã Requirements

- **Node.js** and **npm** must be installed on your system. Download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

```bash
npm install
```

<!-- ## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### ‚úîÔ∏è Prerequisites

Make sure Node.js is installed on your system. You can download it from nodejs.org.
**‚ÑπÔ∏è You don‚Äôt need to install Angular CLI globally**, as it will be included with the project dependencies.

### ‚úîÔ∏è Step-by-step Installation

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone this repository to your local machine:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sofrayala/Travel-journal.git
```

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Navigate to the project directory:**

```bash
cd Travel-journal
```

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Install the required dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Execution

Before starting the application, you need to configure your Supabase credentials ([supabase.com](https://supabase.com/)) and create an account on the official Mapbox API website: [mapbox.com/mapbox-studio](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio).

Inside the `environments/` folder, you will find a file named `environment.example.ts`. Follow these steps:

1. Open the `environment.example.ts` file, which has the following structure:

```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  SUPABASE_URL: "your_supabase_project_link",
  SUPABASE_KEY: "your_supabase_key",
  MAPBOX_TOKEN: "your_mapbox_key",
};
```

2. Fill in your Supabase and Mapbox credentials in the file.
3. Rename the file `environment.example.ts` to `environment.ts`, then copy it and create another file in the same folder named `environment.development.ts`, where you should modify the first line to: `"production: false"`.

To start the application in development mode, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Then, open your browser and go to [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/) to see the app in action.

This README provides a basic guide to set up, use, and contribute to the **Travel Journal** project. Be sure to check the official documentation for Angular, Supabase, and Tailwind for more detailed information and updates.
This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.0.5.

## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Deploying to Vercel

To deploy this Angular project on [Vercel](https://vercel.com), follow these steps:

1. **Update package.json script:**

   ```bash
   "build": "node mynode.js && ng build"
   ```

2. **Create a .js file that generates an envFile:**
   Use the `mynode.js` file as an example, update the environment variables to match yours.

3. **Install dotenv:**

```bash
npm i dotenv
```

4. **Create a .env file:**
   Fill it with your environment variables.

5. **Push the project to GitHub (or any Git provider supported by Vercel).**

6. **Connect the Git repository to Vercel via the Vercel dashboard.**

7. **Set environment variables in the Vercel project settings:**

   Go to **Settings > Environment Variables**
   Add the same variables you use locally (e.g., Supabase keys, Mapbox token).

8. **Deploy:**
   Vercel will automatically build and deploy the app.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/). The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
